This project is an idea I got at 1 am, don't trust I will finish it soon xD

## Main idea:
Okay, my idea on this project is covering these points:
<ul>
  <li>Make a character database where you can easily pick a character from the game, and choose the build you have on them</li>
  <li>Make an online database in </li>
  <li>Divide builds into different lists, making it possible to save different builds of the same character</li>
  <li>Choose the level of anything related to each character (Their weapon's, their artifacts', their talent's, etc.)</li>
</ul>

## Future ideas:
These are a bit apart from the others bc of their complexity, but it would be cool to try:
<ul>
  <li>Calculate character's stats depending on what have everyone put on the app</li>
  <li>Make recommendations for each character (Example: "Your Qiqi should use: 1.Ocean-Hued Clam 2.Maven Beloved</li>
  <li>Show info about other artifacts in other section of the app</li>
  <li>(IMPOSSIBLE) Interactive map about where are the different domains</li>
</ul>

This is a long-term project and I will need a lot of time to make everything work correctly, and there's always another way to improve both the project and oneself
